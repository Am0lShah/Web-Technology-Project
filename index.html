                { question: "Which data structure uses LIFO?", options: ["Queue", "Stack", "Array", "Linked List"], correctAnswer: "Stack", explanation: "Stack uses Last In, First Out (LIFO). Queue is FIFO; Array and Linked List are general structures, not order-specific." },
                { question: "What does 'null' represent in Java?", options: ["0", "Empty string", "No object reference", "False"], correctAnswer: "No object reference", explanation: "'null' means no object is referenced. 0 is an integer; empty string is ''; False is a boolean, all distinct from null." },
